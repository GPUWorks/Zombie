Zombie
======
A project aiming to produce a simple 2D-shooter zombie game.

The development is done in Visual Studio 2012.
External libraries used is SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), box2d, and a home made developed library based on SDL.
Box2D is a feature rich 2D rigid body physics engine. The own developed library is c++ wrapper of SDL
but is not published on github, therefore the code can not be compiled without it.
