Zombie
======
A project aiming to produce a simple 2D-shooter zombie game.

The development is done in Visual Studio 2012.
External libraries used is a SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and own developt library based on SDL.
The own developt library is c++ wrapper of SDL but is not published on github,
therefor the code can not be compiled without it.
